fishing excursion to find your home completely abandoned, worse yet you're being hunted by a mysterious force<br>
of deadly machines. As you explore Generation Zero you will find bunkers and missions to do. The pieces of<br>

<p>In the World of Generation Zero, you have to constantly be on the lookout for enemies, while trying to<br> 
figure out what has happened here. You can play Generation Zero with up to three of your friends in a seamless<br> 
co-op. Generation Zero has a weather system that just won’t disable your senses, but the machines' senses.<br> 
Generation Zero has an interactive world, you can set up traps using electrical boxes to EMP your enemies and<br>
make a hard fight an easy one. Should things go south, fleeing is a valid tactic. If you didn’t kill an enemy in<br> 
one of your fights then the machine will continue roaming bearing the scars waiting for you to finish them off.<br>
